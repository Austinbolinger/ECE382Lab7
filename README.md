Description: Lab 7 is IR senors talking to the MSP430. This builds off of lab 6 where we found a way to use our remote controlls to operate the robot. Now the IR sensors built in to the robot will detect walls. It is up to me to use code to turn on LEDs to show that it is detecting walls.

**Hardware Setup**
This is what the MSP430 looks like in picture form.

The pins I chose are important. As you can see below, they line up with A3, A4, & A5 which will be used in the coding.
